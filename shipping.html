customer contacts after 24
hours of purchase time then they will not be able to cancel their order. If your order is
already processed or has
already shipped, we cannot cancel the order. Customers will need to either refuse the package
and immediately notify
<a href="#"><span class="#" data-cfemail="#">[sale@buyhealthyproduct.store]</span></a> the date it was

refund.
